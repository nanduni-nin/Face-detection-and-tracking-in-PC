## Using RANSAC for estimating geometric transforms in computer vision

Random sample consensus is an iterative method for estimating a mathematical model from a data set that contains outliers. The RANSAC algorithm works by identifying the outliers in a data set and estimating the desired model using data that does not contain outliers.

### RANSAC is accomplished with the following steps :

1.	Randomly selecting a subset of the data set
2.	Fitting a model to the selected subset
3.	Determining the number of outliers
4.	Repeating steps 1-3 for a prescribed number of iterations

### Approach :

Detection is performed by creating a cascade detector object â€“ Viola Johnes
*	Create a cascade detector object for initial face detection : CascadeObjectDetector('FrontalFaceCART')
*	Save location of face as a polygon

The tracking is performed by means of continuous detection.
*	Create and Initialize Tracker
*	Find points on detected objects using minimum eigen features
*	Loop through video, get the next frame, Use vision.pointTracker to track feature points
*	Keep only the valid points and discard the rest, Save the new state of the point tracker
*	If new visible points>2, filter outliers using RANSAC
*	Find bounding box by applying the transformation to the bounding box from previous frame to current frame
*	Insert the bounding box around the object being tracked
*	Display tracked points
